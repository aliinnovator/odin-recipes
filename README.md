# Odin Recipes Project

The first project from TOP after the HTML part. I named it **Spicy With The
Sweetie** inspired by my own recipes list. Featuring tantalizing dishes like
Chicken Wings, Shawarma, and the sweetie Chai (Doah pati one) ðŸ˜‚. Let's add a
bit of fun to this coding journey...!

## My Approach For This Project

### I plan to approach the project in two iterations:

**HTML Version (First Iteration):**  
Here I will just Develop the HTML structure of the recipe website to follow up
with the lesson and submit the version of my solution and move ahead.

**Enhancements with CSS (Second Iteration):**  
Apply CSS styles to improve the appearance and layout of the website.

## Challenges and Learnings

Throughout the project, I will document the challenges and difficulties I
encounter, along with the strategies I employ to overcome them. By sharing my
experiences, I aim to provide insights and assistance to others who may face
similar obstacles.

## Challenges I Faced

While this project seemed straightforward at first, navigating the intricacies
of Linux commands and setting up Linux with WSL presented unexpected hurdles.
However, through perseverance and problem-solving, I managed to find solutions
for each obstacle encountered.

**Problem 1: VS Code Setup Issues**  
Initially, I encountered difficulties with setting up VS Code, particularly with
extensions like Live Server not functioning properly. This proved to be a
significant roadblock. **Solution To Problem 1**

1. First, I attempted to update extensions that were causing issues, hoping that
   newer versions would resolve any compatibility problems.
2. Next, I installed the Remote Development Pack in VS Code, which helped
   streamline the integration with WSL.
3. Finally, for persisting issues with Live Server, I utilized the command
   **wslview filename (file name you want to open in browser)**.

**Problem 2: Image Display Issues**  
Another challenge arose when images failed to display correctly on the web page
within the WSL environment, despite functioning correctly on my local PC.  
**Solution to Problem 2**  
The solution to this problem revolved around meticulous attention to file paths.
I discovered that adjusting file paths to accommodate the differences between
local and WSL environments was crucial. For example, using ../ instead of / when
navigating one level up from the 'recipes' directory to the 'imgs' directory
proved to be the key to resolving the image display issue.

### First Version End

Despite the initial challenges, I've gained valuable insights into the
complexities of setting up development environments. While the process may be
arduous, the skills acquired are undoubtedly invaluable.  
So with that being said, let me move forward. No more time for this version;
I'll revisit it after the CSS part.

Let's go..............!
